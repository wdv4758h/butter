 Butter
========
"Making things that little bit butter under linux"

Butter is a library to integrate some of Linux's low level features into python
eg signalfd, eventfd and timerfd. most of these functions are handy if you are 
looking into creating non-blocking servers, dealing with event loops or writing
high performance services

Features
---------
 * Full testing of all error conditions in unit tests
 * Small set of exceptions to deal with
 * asyncio compatible versions of calls
 * Emulationa nd reuse of built in objects wherever possible
 * Both low level 1:1 calls and a high level interface available
 * Default values chosen follow 'least surprise' principle (eg CLOCK_MONOTONIC
   instead of CLOCK_REALTIME to avoid issues with clock updates)
 * Single codebase supporting python 2 and python 3 without modifcation for 
   easier forward migration

Whats Available
----------------
 * inotify (Complete support, includes asyncio support)
 * seccomp (Limited support)
 * fanotify (Limited support, includes asyncio support)
 * splice
 * tee
 * vmsplice
 * gethostname
 * sethostname
 * mount
 * umount
 * pivot_root
 * getpid (bypasses glibc caching)
 * getppid (bypasses glibc caching)
 * eventfd (includes asyncio support)
 * timerfd (includes asyncio support)
 * pthread_sigmask (Avalible in python3.x but backported for python2.7)
 * signalfd (includes asyncio support)

Whats Coming
-------------
Most of these exist in v0.2 as ctypes code. these are currently being rewritten
to use cffi for speed and compatibility with pypy

 * posix/linux aio (scatter/gather read writes with a completion based API 
   instead of a 'ready' based interface, eg similar to IOCP on windows)
 * Sphinx documentation
 * Example code
 * More unit tests

Supported Python
-----------------
Butter currently supported the following python interpreters

* pypy (2.7 and 3.2 python implementations)
* cpython 3.4 (required for asyncio support)
* cpython 3.x
* cpython 2.7

Butter may work on older versions however it has not been tested on anything 
except the above interpreters and may break without warning

Installing
-----------
butter makes use of several C libraries to provide low level functionality. most
of the compilation is taken care of by setup.py and cffi at install time however 
you will need to ensure that some header files are available on the machine doing 
the compilation (which may be different to the machine butter is being packaged 
for and Finally installed on)

Dev packages required:
 * libseccomp
 * kernel headers for a fairly recent kernel (3.x recommended)

to install butter use the following command:

    $ pip install butter

this will pull in all the required dependencies and compile the required C 
extensions

for asyncio support, python 3.4 or newer is required. importing the asyncio 
modules on older versions of python will throw a syntax error. Hence why these
are namespaced under butter.asyncio rather than in the base modules

Design
-------
The 'fd' apis have been designed first as thin wrappers around the underlying
kernel syscalls. A File-like object that then uses these syscalls is then made 
available that obeys the 'event like' interface and is based on the interface
provided by File and friends. They are intended to be drop in replacements and 
be used with the select module

Event-like objects
+++++++++++++++++++
Event like objects are identical to filelike objects except they have the 
following extra methods to replace the disabled read/readline/write/writeline
functionality

 * read_event:  Return a single event
 * read_events: Return all cached events OR read all events from the kernel

AsyncIO
++++++++
Some syscalls (ones that deal with fd's) have been made to work with the 
asyncio framework that became avalible in python3.4. The asyncio enabled
object is named after the normal Event-like object equivlent with '_async'
after it, eg Inotify => Inotify_async. These asyncio Eventlike objects are
designed to act and behave like the asyncio.Queue object without the ability
to write events to the queue (ie they can only be read from and events are
injected from the fd as required)


Exceptions
+++++++++++
Butter was designed to have a small set of easily catchable exceptions and to 
reuse the builtin exceptions wherever possible. The list below is a rough
guide of what exceptions you can expect to receive

 * OSError/MemoryError: The Operating system was unable to fulfill your request
 * ValueError: One of the arguments is invalid
 * PermissionError: You do not have sufficient Privileges to use this call
 * InternalError: The function hit an internal bug that was never expected to
   be hit but is tested for just in case. Please consider filing a bug report
 * UnknownError: The Error is not specifically handled and unexpected, see 
   exception.errno for the Error code that generated this exception
